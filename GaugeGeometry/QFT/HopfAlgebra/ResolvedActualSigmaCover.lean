# Final σ-cover data package (Track R-4-superfull)

The R-4-superfull architecture is complete up to **one** remaining construction: an
actual resolved σ-cover.  This file consolidates the remaining obligations into a single
package `ResolvedActualSigmaCover g`, and shows it delivers the concrete H5.8 sum-reindex
identity and the branch classifier.

What is **embedded in `FL`** (`ResolvedFiniteBranchMapLayer`) and so *not* duplicated
here: the layer's `cover` (branch-map surjectivity), `forest_inj`/`mixed_inj`, and the
forest/mixed image data carrying `componentCD`/`remnantCD`/disjointness/`avoidsStars`
(all baked in when `FL` is built from the forest/mixed image data via
`ResolvedBranchMapInstantiation.toLayer`).

What remains **external** (the package's own fields): the resolved→flat
`concreteIndexMaps` and the flat `splitTerm_agreement` (σ-cover data, Field Filling 6).

So the entire remaining R-4-superfull obstruction is: *construct one
`ResolvedActualSigmaCover g`*.

/-! **Report.**  `ResolvedActualSigmaCover g` consolidates the four σ-cover-data-supply
obligations.  Dependency diagram:

```
ResolvedActualSigmaCover g
  ├─ FL : ResolvedFiniteBranchMapLayer        (carries cover, forest_inj, mixed_inj,
  │       └─ layer + carriers                  componentCD/remnantCD, disjoint, avoidsStars)
  ├─ concreteIndexMaps : ResolvedH58ConcreteIndexMaps g FL   (resolved→flat maps + comm)
  └─ splitTerm_agreement                       (flat σ-cover term agreement)

  .concreteData        = concreteIndexMaps.toConcreteData splitTerm_agreement
  .concrete_sum_reindex = the flat-term H5.8 split identity
  .classifier          = FL.layer.toClassifier
```

**Embedded vs external.**  `cover`, branch injectivity, and the image-data graph-work
(CD/disjoint/avoidsStars) are *inside* `FL` — supplied when `FL` is constructed from the
forest/mixed image data (`ResolvedForestImageData`/`ResolvedMixedImageData` →
`ResolvedBranchMapInstantiation.toLayer`).  The package adds only the resolved→flat index
maps and the flat term agreement.

**Remaining R-4-superfull obstruction (single statement):** *construct one
`ResolvedActualSigmaCover g`* — i.e. build the finite branch-map layer from an actual
resolved σ-cover (its forest/mixed image data) and supply the resolved→flat index maps +
flat term agreement.  All four are σ-cover data (non-facade); no abstract structure or new
mathematics remains. -/

/-! ## Construction scout — `canonicalResolvedActualSigmaCover g` field-source table

Target: `noncomputable def canonicalResolvedActualSigmaCover (g) : ResolvedActualSigmaCover g`.
The critical discipline is that **no field may reuse a flat boundary facade** — where flat
used one, the resolved replacement must be used.

| field (path) | source | theorem? | facade status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PFU` | `canonicalResolvedHopfPayloadFamilyWithUniqueIds` | ✅ exists | facade-free (axiom-clean) |
| `FL.layer.forest_inj` | `resolvedForestImage_injective` ← `parentRemnant_injOn` | ✅ | **resolved repair** (replaces `ForestGraphInsertionUniquenessModel`) |
| `FL.layer.mixed_inj` | `mixed_inj_of_components_inj` | ✅ | facade-free (index design) |
| `FL` componentCD/disjoint | `ResolvedMixedImageData.ofAdmissibleSubgraph` | ✅ free | facade-free |
| `FL` avoidsStars | `avoidsStars_of_vertices_offStar` | ✅ | facade-free (star freshness) |
| `FL` remnantDisjoint | pairwise vertex (defeq) | ✅ | facade-free |
| `FL` remnantCD | reflection class | needs class | not facade (power-counting reflection) |
| `concreteIndexMaps` | resolved→flat forget maps + `h58Bridge*` + commutation | to construct | facade-free (forget maps) |
| `splitTerm_agreement` | σ-cover factorization (`RemnantPositiveComponentsCertificate`) | construction data | non-facade |
| **`FL.layer.cover`** | **⚠ flat cover is facade-gated — must rebuild resolved-native** | **genuine remaining** | **flat: PromotedExternalLegs-DEPENDENT; resolved replacement: `resolved_promotedComponent_externalLegs_le_plus`** |

**Critical scout answers.**
- **(A)** ForestIdx/MixedIdx/Image are **resolved-native** (`Image = ResolvedAdmissibleSubgraph
  (Aout.contractWithStars starOf)`; branch maps are resolved parent-remnants / mixed
  components), *not* flat indices transported through `forget`.
- **(B/C)** The only fields where flat used a facade are `forest_inj` (→
  `ForestGraphInsertionUniquenessModel`) and `cover` (→ `PromotedExternalLegsLiftableModel`):
  confirmed by `CoassocStrictForestH58Ready_ofBoundaryFacades` (Coassoc), gated on exactly
  those two.  `forest_inj` already has its resolved replacement (`parentRemnant_injOn`).
- **(D) HALT.**  The flat `cover` certificate is **facade-dependent**
  (`PromotedExternalLegsLiftableModel`) — it cannot be transported.  It must be **rebuilt
  resolved-natively** using `resolved_promotedComponent_externalLegs_le_plus` (the resolved
  promoted-leg containment, built precisely for this) plus the resolved σ-cover
  surjectivity.  **This is the genuine remaining construction sprint** — the one field that
  is not a direct source lookup.

**Verdict.**  Every field except `cover` is sourced facade-free (resolved repairs + index
design + structural lemmas + reflection class).  `cover` is the single genuine remaining
piece: a resolved-native surjectivity built on the resolved promoted-leg containment — the
exact place R-4-superfull's containment lemma was designed to plug in.  So
`canonicalResolvedActualSigmaCover g` is feasible **iff** the resolved cover surjectivity
is constructed; that is the final sprint, and it does **not** reintroduce any flat facade. -/

/-! ## Cover supply — `parentOf` consolidated into the cover preimage data

The cover sprint reduced both cases (mixed: structural; forest: the `parentOf`
component-lift).  Here we consolidate them: a **forest-case supply** (a `parentOf` datum
per forest-by-star image) yields the full `ResolvedCoverPreimageData` — hence the cover —
over the identity-indexed image families.  The only genuine remaining datum is the
forest-case supply (`resolvedParentRemnant` component-level surjectivity, σ-cover data,
facade-free); the mixed half is already structural. -/

/-- The forest-case supply: a parent-lift datum for every forest-by-star image. -/
def ResolvedForestCaseSupply (D : ResolvedSigmaCoverData G) : Type _ :=
  ∀ z : ResolvedActualQuotientImage D, resolvedIsForestByStar D z →
    ResolvedForestCasePreimageData D z

/-- From a forest-case supply: the cover preimage data over the identity-indexed image
families (constructed `forest_case` + structural `mixed_case`). -/
def ResolvedForestCaseSupply.toCoverPreimageData {D : ResolvedSigmaCoverData G}
    (S : ResolvedForestCaseSupply D) :
    ResolvedCoverPreimageData
      (forestData := (fun F => F : ResolvedForestImageData D → ResolvedForestImageData D))
      (mixedData := (fun M => M : ResolvedMixedImageData D → ResolvedMixedImageData D)) where
  forest_case := fun z hz => forest_case_of_preimageData D (S z hz) hz
  mixed_case := fun _ hz => exists_mixed_preimage_of_not_forest D hz

/-- **The cover, from the forest-case supply.**  Every image is a forest or mixed branch
image — the layer's `cover` content, reduced to the single forest-case `parentOf`
supply (facade-free). -/
theorem ResolvedForestCaseSupply.cover {D : ResolvedSigmaCoverData G}
    (S : ResolvedForestCaseSupply D) :
    ∀ z : ResolvedActualQuotientImage D,
      (∃ F : ResolvedForestImageData D, F.toImage = z) ∨
        (∃ M : ResolvedMixedImageData D, M.toImage = z) :=
  S.toCoverPreimageData.cover

/-! **Final report.**  The entire R-4-superfull cover obstruction is now the single datum
`ResolvedForestCaseSupply D` — for each forest-by-star image, a `parentOf` lifting its
components back to parents (`resolvedParentRemnant` component-level surjectivity).  This is
σ-cover data, **not** a flat facade.  Together with the (already-isolated)
`ResolvedH58ConcreteIndexMaps`, `splitTerm_agreement` (σ-cover factorization), and
`remnantCD` (reflection-class), constructing one actual resolved σ-cover supplies every
field of `ResolvedActualSigmaCover g`.  The remaining engineering — assembling these into a
finite branch-map layer (`ResolvedFiniteBranchMapLayer`: finite carriers over the actual
σ-cover's finite branch indices, where `forestImage`/`mixedImage` are injective) — is the
actual σ-cover finiteness construction; it introduces no facade and no new mathematics
beyond the σ-cover data itself. -/
