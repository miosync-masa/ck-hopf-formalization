# R-6c-body-404 — strict-star usage audit + the right-term alpha interface (PROVED feasibility)

Four-hundred-and-fourth genuine-body step — the minimal repair prototype after body-403's no-go.  Instead of changing
`D` wholesale, the replacement LAW is prototyped and its `sum`-proof feasibility is discharged, strict `star_mapPerm`
unused.

## Strict-`star_mapPerm` usage audit (source-confirmed)

`D.star_mapPerm` is CONSUMED in exactly ONE place in the live proof code: `ResolvedCoproductProperForestData.sum_mapPerm`
(`ResolvedHopfCoproductSupply.lean:173`), via `resolvedForestRightTerm_mapPerm`'s per-component star-equality hypothesis
`starOf' (γ.mapPerm σ) = σ (starOf γ)` — which is exactly the strict equivariance body-403 proved inconsistent with
freshness.  Every other occurrence is a docstring / audit anchor or body-403's own no-go.  So the algebra needs only the
`mapPerm`-invariance of the RIGHT TERM, not the strict star equality.

## The minimal alpha law + its `sum`-proof feasibility

* `ResolvedRightTermAlphaSupply D` — the single law `rightTerm_mapPerm`: the forest right term is `mapPerm`-invariant
  (the resolved CLASS of the contraction is relabel-invariant), stated with `D`'s own `starOf` on BOTH sides, so a
  correcting-permutation / alpha-equivalence provider can discharge it WITHOUT a strict fresh-name equivariance.
* `sum_mapPerm_of_rightTermAlpha` — body's `sum_mapPerm`, with its ONLY `star_mapPerm` use replaced by
  `Alpha.rightTerm_mapPerm`; strict `star_mapPerm` NEVER touched.

Per the HALT: the old `ResolvedCoproductProperForestData` is NOT changed; only the strict-`star_mapPerm`-free `sum`-proof
feasibility is proved; the correcting permutation itself is NOT built; the term-level law is NOT read as "the star
equality was proved".  The atomic migration (retire `star_mapPerm` → introduce `rightTerm_mapPerm` → swap `sum_mapPerm`
→ migrate `W` / supported-carrier / body-400 chain) is body-405.  No facade, no flat term, no `forgetHopf`, no rep/perm,
and NO `promote_collapse` / singleton / floor-297.
