# Resolved subgraph spine (Track R-4-full, Phase 1a)

The boundary-resolved analogue of `FeynmanSubgraph`, the lowest layer of the full
resolved CK Hopf rebuild.  A `ResolvedFeynmanSubgraph G` carries the same shape as
the flat `FeynmanSubgraph` but over the identity-carrying resolved edge/leg
carriers, and `forget` projects it to a flat `FeynmanSubgraph G.forget`.

The headline compatibility is `forget_toFeynmanGraph`:
`γ.forget.toFeynmanGraph = γ.toResolvedFeynmanGraph.forget` — forgetting commutes
with taking the intrinsic graph.  This is the spine fact the resolved
contraction / coproduct layers (later phases) build on.

Phase 1a only: subgraph + forget + the commuting square.  No admissible subgraph,
contraction, coproduct, or `HopfGen` yet.  Existing flat development untouched.

/-! ## Phase 1b — resolved admissible subgraph (forest carrier)

The resolved analogue of `AdmissibleSubgraph`: a finite set of resolved
subgraphs that are (i) connected-divergent *after forgetting* and (ii) pairwise
vertex-disjoint.  Divergence is inherited via the forgetful projection — resolved
graphs carry no power-counting of their own; their physical content is read off
`forget`.  Hence `DivergenceMeasure` is required only on the flat ambient
`G.forget`, supplied by the global power-counting environment. -/

/-! ### Phase 1c — resolved contraction spine

`componentAt` picks the component containing a vertex; `retargetVertex` collapses
each component's vertices to a caller-supplied star; `contractWithStars` rewrites
the complement edges/legs through that map.  All mirror the flat
`AdmissibleSubgraph` API.  The headline `forget_contractWithStars` shows that
forgetting the resolved contraction is the flat retarget of the *forgotten*
complement — the honest projection (it does **not** equal the flat
`contractWithStars`, because `forget` does not distribute over multiset
subtraction; that non-distribution is exactly the boundary collapse Track R
repairs). -/
