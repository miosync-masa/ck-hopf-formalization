# Resolved subgraph spine (Track R-4-full, Phase 1a)

The boundary-resolved analogue of `FeynmanSubgraph`, the lowest layer of the full
resolved CK Hopf rebuild.  A `ResolvedFeynmanSubgraph G` carries the same shape as
the flat `FeynmanSubgraph` but over the identity-carrying resolved edge/leg
carriers, and `forget` projects it to a flat `FeynmanSubgraph G.forget`.

The headline compatibility is `forget_toFeynmanGraph`:
`γ.forget.toFeynmanGraph = γ.toResolvedFeynmanGraph.forget` — forgetting commutes
with taking the intrinsic graph.  This is the spine fact the resolved
contraction / coproduct layers (later phases) build on.

Phase 1a only: subgraph + forget + the commuting square.  No admissible subgraph,
contraction, coproduct, or `HopfGen` yet.  Existing flat development untouched.

The resolved analogue of `AdmissibleSubgraph`: a finite set of resolved
subgraphs that are (i) connected-divergent *after forgetting* and (ii) pairwise
vertex-disjoint.  Divergence is inherited via the forgetful projection — resolved
graphs carry no power-counting of their own; their physical content is read off
`forget`.  Hence `DivergenceMeasure` is required only on the flat ambient
`G.forget`, supplied by the global power-counting environment. -/

/-- **Resolved remainder insertion-uniqueness** (resolved `ForestGraphInsertion
UniquenessModel`).  If two source subgraphs share their vertex set, both contain
the outer forest's internal edges, and have equal quotient remainders, then —
under id-uniqueness — they are equal.  On the flat carrier this fails (the
retarget collapses distinct edges/legs); the persistent `edgeId`/`legId` make it
hold here. -/
